Subject: [PATCH 1/1] skip-test-fix-OBS-build

During the OBS build process, a unit test attempts to start a service on port 80 with the expectation of failure.
However, due to the OBS permission management mechanism, the service on port 80 can be started successfully,
resulting in the failure of the unit test. Therefore, we have decided to disable this unit test.
